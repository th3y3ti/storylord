# Storylord - Your Meta-Narrative Story and Screenwriting Assistant

**App Concept:** Storylord - Your Meta-Narrative Screenwriting Assistant

**Core Idea:** This app assists users in writing or reviewing stories and screenplays, with AI agents providing feedback, suggestions, and meta-commentary at every stage. The agents, inspired by Rick and Morty Episodes, offer both helpful and hilariously disruptive input, ensuring the screenwriting process is anything but ordinary.

## Key Features:

### Agent-Assisted Screenwriting:

* The app has 3 modes: writer, critic, and cynic
* Users work on their screenplay within the app, writing scene by scene.
* At each stage, different agents offer their unique perspectives:
    * **Connie Tinuityerror:** Checks for inconsistencies in the plot, character development, and world-building, and formatting.
    * **Miss Lead:** Provides misleading suggestions and critiques, leading the writer down false paths.
    * **Flash Back:** Inserts random flashbacks and suggests plotlines based on past events (even if irrelevant).
    * **Protago Nick:** Focuses on making the main character the "hero" of the story, sometimes at the expense of other elements.
    * **Mr. Twist:** Suggests unexpected plot twists and reversals, some of which may be illogical or unsatisfying.
    * **Rhett Conn's Interference:**
        * Throughout the writing process, Rhett Conn appears to offer "advice," which may include:
            * Randomly changing character names or plot points.
            * Inserting bizarre or nonsensical scenes.
            * Demanding the inclusion of specific (and often absurd) elements.
            * Adding meta commentary about the writing process.

### Meta-Narrative Tools:

* The app includes features to help users explore meta-narrative techniques:
    * A "Fourth-Wall Breaker" tool that suggests ways to directly address the audience.
    * A "Trope Subversion" generator that provides ideas for twisting common tropes.
    * A "Meaning Analyzer" that helps users explore the philosophical implications of their story.

### Character Profiler:

* Users input details about their characters.
* The app uses the details to ensure the agents are consistent in their feedback.
* The agents can use the character details to generate dialog, plot suggestions, and conflicts.

### Chekhov's Gun Tracker:

* A special feature to help writers manage Chekhov's Guns:
    * When a significant element is introduced (an object, a character trait, a piece of information), the writer can log it as a potential Chekhov's Gun.
    * The app reminds the writer to pay it off later in the script.
    * Agents can also analyze the script for potential Chekhov's Guns and point out any that haven't been used.

### Screenplay Formatting Tools:

* The app provides tools to ensure the screenplay adheres to industry-standard formatting (e.g., scene headings, action lines, dialogue).
* It can also suggest creative ways to play with formatting for meta-narrative purposes.

### Output Formats:

* The app supports exporting the finished screenplay in industry-standard formats (e.g., .pdf, .fdx).
* It could also generate a "meta-commentary" track that includes the agents' notes and suggestions alongside the text.

## Agent Roles in the Screenwriting Process:

* **Connie Tinuityerror:**
    * Identifies contradictions in the timeline, character actions, and established rules of the story's world.
    * Checks for screenplay formatting errors and inconsistencies.
    * Example: "In Scene 3, you said the protagonist can't drive, but in Scene 7, they're in a car chase. Explain?"
* **Miss Lead:**
    * Provides deceptive feedback, leading the writer down unproductive paths.
    * Example: "The villain's motivation is too obvious. Make them a misunderstood puppy."
* **Flash Back:**
    * Suggests inserting flashbacks, even if they disrupt the narrative flow.
    * Example: "This scene would be more impactful if we saw a flashback to the protagonist's childhood trauma... even if it has nothing to do with the current plot."
* **Protago Nick:**
    * Pushes the writer to make the protagonist the focus of every scene.
    * Example: "How can we make this scene more about the main character? Maybe they can solve this problem with their unique ability, even if it feels forced?"
* **Mr. Twist:**
    * Advocates for shocking and unexpected plot twists, even if they defy logic.
    * Example: "What if the main character is actually a robot? And they don't find out until the very last scene?!?!"
* **Rhett Conn:**
    * Inserts random plot twists: "Suddenly, a giant robot attacks!"
    * Changes character motivations: "The hero now wants to become a competitive pickleball player."
    * Demands inclusion of absurd elements: "This scene needs more sentient furniture."
    * Adds unhelpful meta-commentary: "This whole screenplay is derivative. You should just start over."

## Example Interaction:

* **User:** "I'm stuck on how to end Scene 5."
* **Connie Tinuityerror:** "In the previous scene, you established that the MacGuffin can only be activated at dawn. It's currently midnight. Is there a reason the characters are trying to activate it now?"
* **Miss Lead:** "The best way to end this scene is to introduce a completely new character with a mysterious past and have them solve everything."
* **Rhett Conn:** "The scene ends with the main character revealing they were a sentient dog all along. Boom! Best ending ever."
* **User:** "I want to introduce a mysterious object in this scene. How can I make it a Chekhov's Gun?"
* **Chekhov's Gun Tracker:** "Log the object in the tracker and make a note of how it might be used later in the story. For example, will it be a weapon, a key, or a clue?"
